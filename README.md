# Todo List App with React-Hooks.

This project is a simple application to list a series of tasks to perform. You can create, read, edit, update and delete.
It is based on forms handling exercises such as CRUD exercises. 

## Todo List App with React-Hooks.

The easiest way to create an `npx create-crxjs` this, is by creating a Typescript React template.

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, enable "Developer mode", and load the unpacked extension from the `dist` directory.

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Chrome Extension Development Notes

- Use `manifest.config.ts` to configure your extension
- The CRXJS plugin automatically handles manifest generation
- Popup UI should be placed in `src/popup/`
